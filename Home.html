        <p>The Koh-i-Noor diamond is one of the largest in the world and it weighs 105.6 carats, when it arrived in Britain it weighed 190.3 carats but due to common dissapointment in the appearance of the gem Prince Albert commissioned to have it polished and cut down to get the shine and the appearance just right.</p>
        <p>The Koh-i-Noor was a gift to Queen Victoria from the East India Trading company+ </p>
        <p>The earliest history of the Koh-i-noor diamond is currently in contention as there is claims from India, Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, as well as the Taliban but it is currently in the possession of the Royal Family of United Kingdom.</p>
