        <h1 class="sub">British Ownership of the Koh-i-Noor</h1>
        <div class="left">
            <p>In 1849 the East India Trading company presented the Koh-i_noor to Queen Victoria who wrote in her will that only women may wear it so as to avoid the wrath of the curse and it has remained in the possession of the British Royal family ever since.</p>
            <p>When the diamond arrived in Great Britain it weighed rougly 186 carats but Prince Albert ordered the diamond to be cut down and polished to its current size of 105.6 carats, this was following widespread dissapointment in the appearance of the stone. This added 8 facets above the usual 58 facets required to be classed as a brilliant-cut diamond. </p>
            <p>Queen Victoria wore the diamon in a brooch, which in the 1870s she wrote in a letter that she hated. Queen Victoria despised wearing the jewel as she regrets how they acquired it.</p>
            <p>After Queen Victorias death the diamond was set in the Crwon of Queen Alexandra for her coronation and this was used to crown her during her coronation.</p>
            <p>The diamond was in Queen Marys crown in 1911 and then The Queen other Queen Elizabeths crown in 1937</p>
            <p>During the Second World War the Crwon Jewels were transported from the Tower of London to Windsor castle.</p>
            <p>In 1941 the Koh-i-Noor was moved to a specially designed tunnel where it was wrapped in cotton wool and placed in a biscuit tin</p>
            <p>The Koh-i-Noor still remains in the possession of the British Royal Family, but the legitimacy of their ownership is in constant contention.</p>
