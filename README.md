Top middle rectangle is header and navbar and bottom rectangle is footer. All other rectangles are for images, this layout was original layout designed for all web pages to keep them uniform, since this stage there has been pages added such as submittedform.html and contactus.html and the layout was changed slightly to make it nicer for the viewer.

## Features 

- __Navigation Bar__

- this is featured on all pages of the website including the submittedform/thank you page.
- This has links to every page except for the thank you page as this can only be reached through the form submit button.
- The navbar is fully responsive and should still look good on any screen size.

## Testing

I have tested this webpage using W3C validator for HTML and Jigsaw validator for CSS.
I encountered one bug on the submittedform.html page when trying to redirect back to homepage after 10 seconds, I could not make it work on all browsers, when looking for fixes I found that W3C deprecate this practice so I removed this code entirely.

### Validator Testing

 - HTML
  - No errors returned on any page when running through the official [W3C Validator]
 - CSS
  - No errors returned when running through the official [Jigsaw Validator]

## Deployment 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
