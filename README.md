Top middle rectangle is header and navbar and bottom rectangle is footer. All other rectangles are for images, this layout was original layout designed for all web pages to keep them uniform, since this stage there has been pages added such as submittedform.html and contactus.html and the layout was changed slightly to make it nicer for the viewer.

## Features

- this is featured on all pages of the website including the submittedform/thank you page.
- This has links to every page except for the thank you page as this can only be reached through the form submit button.
- The navbar is fully responsive and should still look good on any screen size.
