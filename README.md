This project was made in HTML and CSS to showcase the history and the wherabouts of the koh-i-noor diamond. The target audience of this website is an educational or general interest audience.

This website is aimed at students studying History looking to broaden their knowledge or history lovers typically above 45 who are curious about artifacts. Also suited to diamond lovers and history buffs of all ages.

This website can be used in an educational setting as the information although non exhaustive, accurately portrays the whereabouts of the Koh-i-Noor from before its first recorded sighting up to its current whereabouts.

## User Stories

- As a  hobbyist, I can navigate the pages easily so that I can find the information I want without too much time.


## Wireframe

Wireframe was created with Balsamiq and some changes have been made since this stage

![Wireframe](https://github.com/Mbutler1991/Koh-iNoor/blob/master/assets/Screenshots/wireframe.png) 

Top middle rectangle is header and navbar and bottom rectangle is footer. All other rectangles are for images, this layout was original layout designed for all web pages to keep them uniform, since this stage there has been pages added such as submittedform.html and contactus.html and the layout was changed slightly to make it nicer for the viewer.

## Features

- this is featured on all pages of the website including the submittedform/thank you page.
- This has links to every page except for the thank you page as this can only be reached through the form submit button.
- The navbar is fully responsive and should still look good on any screen size.

## Testing

I have tested this webpage using W3C validator for HTML and Jigsaw validator for CSS.
I tested this for accessibility across multiple different browsers and used Google Dev tools to check accross devices.
I also used Wave to check for contrast and errors and found no errors and a contrast ratio of 8.59:1

### Bugs

I encountered one bug on the submittedform.html page when trying to redirect back to homepage after 10 seconds, I could not make it work on all browsers, when looking for fixes I found that W3C deprecate this practice so I removed this code entirely.
I encountered one bug on my index page where the image for the timeline was saving to GitHub as 'Timeline.png' instead of 'timeline.png' no matter what I tried, including deleting, redownloading and pushing the image to no avail. Got assistance from Slack community to fix by renaming as an entirely different name and then changing name back. This worked and bug has been fixed.

### Validator Testing

 - HTML
  - No errors returned on any page when running through the official [W3C Validator]
 - CSS
  - No errors returned when running through the official [Jigsaw Validator]
