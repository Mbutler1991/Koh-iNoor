00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:08.519
gold jewels diamonds everywhere God Save

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.280
the King but in all the pageantry of the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.400
king's coronation one significant peace

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.500
was missing from Queen Camillus crowd

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.279
which featured dazzling stones for sure

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.039
but not the famous kohanuar Diamond the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.500
105 carat jewel in the crown made for

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.460
Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother for a

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.099
coronation in 1937 a centerpiece of the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.680
crown jewels since the 19th century

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.320
during British colonial rule of the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.540
Indian subcontinent the earliest records

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.520
of the corner Diamond place it here in

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.800
Delhi in the jewels-studded Peacock

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.960
Throne of the Mughal Empire for

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.660
centuries the treasured gem was passed

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.300
around and as The Story Goes brought

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.640
Calamity with it but when Buckingham

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.579
Palace announced earlier this year that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.280
Queen Camilla would not Don the koenoor

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.039
it was less about a curse than to

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.500
sidestep controversy and growing demands

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.840
for Britain to give it up you've still

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.080
woken up and be working it's it's dark

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.900
magic again who really owns the Kohinoor

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.960
is a riddle that reaches back centuries

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.119
but understanding where it is now is a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.000
journey that starts here in India

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.299
passing through Mughal Persian and

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.820
Afghan Empires and the first Maharaja of

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.460
the Sikh Empire who received it as a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.040
gift this was documented this then this

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.860
they made it Sandeep Singh sukher chakia

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.619
a lawyer here claims to be a descendant

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.680
and says his family is pursuing the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.780
Kohinoor to fulfill the maharaja's dying

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.820
wish

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.619
this matter is between two royal

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.020
families

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.720
two royal families what makes the claim

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.299
of your family more legitimate the

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.140
britishers have taken it illegally so

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:01.380
this doesn't need any legal action it's

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.780
just a polite reminder that you are the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.399
custodian of this

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.020
diamond

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:12.480
right and you should give it back to us

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.080
but after Britain's East India a company

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.080
annexed Punjab in 1849 the young

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.860
Maharaja then signed a treaty that

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.200
gifted the jewel to Queen Victoria

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.200
kohanur meaning mountain of light became

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.480
a symbol of Empire and in the sense the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.080
Korean symbolizes that it's one in one

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.640
tiny little package as big as an egg is

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.400
all the hurt or the feeling of of loss

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.200
or the feeling of theft which many

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.920
Indians now feel about the colonial

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.080
period giving back the co-enure is

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.239
but it's louder now with India India's

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.120
rise as a global power

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.459
you have been as determined as vinod

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.739

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.420
that they can't do anything about it

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.420
he says he will keep writing to King

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.640
Charles until the kohenur is in its

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.360
