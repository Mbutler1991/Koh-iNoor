            <div class="left">
                <p>In the 16th to the 17th century rubies and spinels had surpassed diamonds as the most valuable gems, and in 1635 Shah Jahan had so many gems he commissioned the creation of the ornate Peacock Throne.</p>
                <p>103 years later after Nader Shah of Persia invaded North-West India taking the Peacock Throne and the first recorded sighting of the Koh-i-Noor was found in the head of one of the peacocks. </p>
                <p>Nader Shahs grandson gave the Koh-i-Noor to Ahmad Shah Durrani of the Afghan Empire as long as Ahmad Shah Durrani offered his support in return.</p>
                <p>Ahmads grandson Shuja fled to Pakistan with the diamond after being overthrown for joining up with the United Kingdom due to rumours of a Russian invasion, where Shuja parted with the diamond to ranjit Singh for his hospitality in 1813.</p>
                <p>Ranjit wore the diamond on his turban for all his subjects to see as he paraded through Lahore on his elephant, until in 1839 he died of his third stroke and after a lot of contention Beli Ram decided to keep it in his vaults as he claimed it was property of the state.</p>
                <p>Later in 1839 Gulab Singh, Raja of Jammu came into possession of the Koh-i-Noor after who held onto it until 1841 when he offered it for emperor Sher Singhs favour. </p>
                <p>In 1843 Sher Singh was assassinated in a coup, and following a counter coup the following day his assassins were assassinated and 5 year old Duleep Singh was installed as emperor and wore the diamond fastened to his arm in the court of Lahore. </p>
                <p>In 1849 after the second Anglo-Sikh war the kingdom was annexed and Queen Victoria took ownership of the diamond which was first acquired by the East India Trading Company</p>
                <p>In a Hindu text there is a superstition about the diamond that says the curse of the diamond will kill any man who tries to own it and only God or women can wear it safely</p>
