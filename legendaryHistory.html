            <p>According to the diary of Alauddin Khalji the diamond fell into the possession of the Khalji dynasty in the late 13th/early 14th century when they invaded the kingdoms of southern India.</p>
            <p>Babur wrote about a large diamond that weighed the same as the approximate weight of the koh-i-noor at 186 carats in 1526.</p>
            <p>It was also alleged that Hortense Borgia reduced the weight to the original known weight of 186 carats and thathe received a large penalty for this</p>
            <p>None of this information can be verified but this is the legendary history of the diamond</p>
